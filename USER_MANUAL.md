GENCA MPE Ultra Continuum - Operating Manual
The GENCA MPE Ultra Continuum is a professional-grade web-based hybrid synthesizer and sampler designed for expressive performance. It bridges the gap between traditional MIDI controllers and MPE-enabled sound design.

1. Getting Started & Connectivity
Browser Requirements
Recommended: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Opera.

Why: These browsers natively support Web MIDI and Web Audio APIs, which are essential for low-latency performance.

MIDI Configuration
Open the MIDI & SYNTH tab.

MIDI In: Select your external keyboard or virtual MIDI bridge (e.g., loopMIDI or IAC Driver).

MIDI Out/Thru: Use these to route the processed MIDI (with scale/chord data) back into your DAW or other hardware.

Internal Synth: Toggle "INTERNAL SYNTH" to ON to use the built-in wavetable engine.

2. The Hybrid Sound Engine
Internal Synth (Wavetable)
WT Type: Choose the base wavetable waveform.

WT Mix: Blend between different wave shapes for evolving textures.

Sampler Section
Loading Samples: Use the + icons in the 7 available slots to upload your own .wav files.

Factory Library: Use the dropdown menu to select pre-loaded instrument sets.

Controls: * Sampler Gain: Adjusts the overall volume of the samples.

Loop Mode: Toggle between one-shot and looped playback.

Max Voices: Limits polyphony to save CPU or create specific textures.

3. Harmonic Engine (Scales & Chords)
Scale Settings
Root & Octaves: Set the fundamental key and the vertical range of the performance area.

Diatonic/Microtonal: Choose from classic Western scales (Major, Minor, Dorian) or explore world/microtonal scales.

Custom Scale: Click the notes on the visual interface to create your own scale; use the 💾 (Save) icon to store it.

Chord Generator
Group Menu: Located at the bottom right. Change Off to Auto (Diatonic) or specific structures like Power 5, Maj7, or 13th.

Inversion: Shift the notes of the chord (Root, 1st, 2nd, 3rd position).

Spread: Increases the distance between chord notes for a "wider" cinematic sound.

4. Performance & MPE Interaction
The "Ghost Circles" (Visual Interaction)
When you play a note on your physical MIDI keyboard, a green circle appears on the screen.

Horizontal Movement (X-Axis): Click and drag a circle left or right to perform a Pitch Slide. The note will move smoothly between frequencies.

Vertical Movement (Y-Axis): Drag the circle up or down to modulate the assigned parameter (usually Filter Cutoff or Wavetable Position).

Snap Rate: Controls how quickly the note "snaps" back to the perfect pitch of the scale when released.

Advanced MPE Settings
PB Range: Set this to match your DAW/Plugin (e.g., +/- 48) for accurate pitch bending.

Link Y > Press/Vel: Maps the vertical position to MIDI Aftertouch (Pressure) or Velocity.

Area Sens: Adjusts how sensitive the "ghost circles" are to mouse/touch input.

5. Effects (FX) & Arpeggiator
FX Control Panel
The signal flow is: Filter → Chorus → Delay → Reverb.

Filter: Features a dedicated ADSR Envelope (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) and Resonance control.

Delay: Includes a D Rev (Reverse) mode for psychedelic textures.

FX Mix: Controls the overall balance of the effect chain.

Arpeggiator (ARP)
Sync: Choose between Internal BPM or MIDI clock from your DAW.

Rate: Set the speed (1/4 to 1/32, including triplets).

Gate: Adjusts the length of the arpeggiated notes.

6. Recording & Exporting
