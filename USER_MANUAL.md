GENCA MPE Ultra Continuum - Master Manual
The GENCA MPE Ultra Continuum is a browser-based hybrid instrument that combines Wavetable Synthesis with Multi-slot Sampling. It is designed to be played as a standalone synth or as a bridge for external MIDI controllers, offering high-level expressive control (MPE).

1. The Hybrid Sound Engine (Standalone Power)
Unlike standard synths, the Continuum allows you to layer digital synthesis with organic recordings.

A. Internal Wavetable Synth
WT Type: Select the fundamental waveform shape.

WT Mix: Morphs between different wave states to create evolving textures.

Best Use: Provides the "electronic" core of your sound, ideal for sharp leads or deep sub-basses.

B. Multi-Slot Sampler
7 Slots: Load up to 7 independent .wav files.

Library: Access the Factory Library for instant instruments or use the + button to upload your own.

Sampler Gain: Mix the volume of your samples against the Wavetable synth.

Loop Mode: Set to Loop ON for sustained pads or OFF for percussive, one-shot hits.

Pro Tip: Combine a "String" sample with a "Square" wavetable and use the WT Mix to find the perfect hybrid balance.

2. Expressive Performance: The "Ghost Circles"
The visual interface is a "play zone" where you interact with active voices.

Triggering Notes: You can play using your PC Keyboard (QWERTY) or by clicking directly on the screen.

Visual Feedback: Every active note appears as a Green Ghost Circle.

X-Axis (Horizontal): Click and drag a circle left or right to perform a Pitch Slide. This allows for fretless-style transitions between notes.

Y-Axis (Vertical): Drag a circle up or down to modulate the sound (Filter Cutoff or Wavetable position).

Snap Rate: Located in the ADVANCED tab. It determines how quickly a "bent" note returns to its perfect pitch. High values = instant snap; Low values = slow glide back.

3. Harmonic & Chord Engine
Transform a single note into a complex musical structure.

Scale Selection
Scales: Choose from over 20 scales (Diatonic, Minor, Arabic, Hirajoshi, etc.).

Microtonal: Access non-Western tuning systems or create a Custom Scale using the Note/Cents editor.

Root & Octaves: Define the global key and the playable range of the interface.

The Chord Generator (Group Menu)
Located in the bottom-right corner, the GROUP menu is a powerful tool:

Auto (Diatonic): Automatically generates the correct chord (Major/Minor/Dim) based on your selected scale.

Fixed Structures: Force every note to become a specific chord (e.g., Sus2, Maj9, 13th).

Inversion & Spread: Use the CHORD tab to flip the notes or spread them across octaves for a wider "cinematic" feel.

4. Connectivity & DAW Integration (Ableton Live)
The app can act as a "brain" for your external gear or software.

MIDI In: Select your physical keyboard. The app will apply your Scale/Chord settings to every note you play.

MIDI Out: Route the app’s processed MIDI to Ableton Live or other VSTs using a virtual cable (loopMIDI on Windows / IAC Driver on Mac).

MPE Conversion: Even if your keyboard is a standard MIDI controller, you can use the Ghost Circles on screen to add MPE-style pitch slides and Y-axis modulations to your DAW tracks.

5. Sound Sculpting (FX & Arpeggiator)
FX Control Panel
Filter: High-quality resonant filter with a dedicated ADSR Envelope.

Chorus: Adds thickness and stereo width.

Delay: Includes D Time, Feedback, and a D Rev (Reverse) mode for ambient soundscapes.

Reverb: A lush spatial processor with adjustable Decay and Mix.

Arpeggiator (ARP)
Sync: Toggle between Internal BPM or MIDI Clock sync.

Rate: Divisions from 1/4 down to 1/32 (including Triplets).

Gate: Adjusts the "staccato" vs "legato" feel of the arpeggio.

6. Recording and Export
The app includes a built-in mastering-grade recorder.

Hit the ● (Record) button in the transport bar.

Once finished, hit ■ (Stop).

The Recording Editor opens:

Select All or trim the audio to your liking.

Name the file and hit 💾 Save.

The app exports a high-fidelity .wav file directly to your downloads folder.
